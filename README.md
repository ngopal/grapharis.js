grapharis.js
============

A set of scripts used to interact, model, and visualize graph and network structures.

Dependencies: Underscore.js is the only dependency.

Please see wiki for cookbook.

Files:
model.js - contains the graph model that the rest of the libraries expect to see.

parse.js - contains parsers to convert from standard file formats to a list of nodes and edges (which can be fed as input arguments to the graph model defined in model.js)
